	abstract = {Diverse proprietary network appliances increase both the capital and operational expense of service providers, meanwhile causing problems of network ossification. Network function virtualization ({NFV}) is proposed to address these issues by implementing network functions as pure software on commodity and general hardware. {NFV} allows flexible provisioning, deployment, and centralized management of virtual network functions. Integrated with {SDN}, the software-defined {NFV} architecture further offers agile traffic steering and joint optimization of network functions and resources. This architecture benefits a wide range of applications (e.g., service chaining) and is becoming the dominant form of {NFV}. In this survey, we present a thorough investigation of the development of {NFV} under the software-defined {NFV} architecture, with an emphasis on service chaining as its application. We first introduce the software-defined {NFV} architecture as the state of the art of {NFV} and present relationships between {NFV} and {SDN}. Then, we provide a historic view of the involvement from middlebox to {NFV}. Finally, we introduce significant challenges and relevant solutions of {NFV}, and discuss its future research directions by different application domains.},

	abstract = {Network Function Virtualization ({NFV}) offers network operators great flexibility toward managing network functions, i.e. in-network appliances such as firewalls, load balancers and {NATs}. Several frameworks exist to this end; however {VNF} management is fragmented, and no standard management {API} exists. As a result, each framework uses a proprietary {API} which a network function must support to fully realize its benefits. This lack of standardization is a major barrier in the wider adoption of {NFV}. We propose a standard, framework-agnostic southbound {API} to facilitate faster adoption of {NFV} and enable innovation in the design of both management frameworks and network functions.},

	abstract = {5G wireless technology is paving the way to revolutionize future ubiquitous and pervasive networking, wireless applications, and user quality of experience. To realize its potential, 5G must provide considerably higher network capacity, enable massive device connectivity with reduced latency and cost, and achieve considerable energy savings compared to existing wireless technologies. The main objective of this article is to explore the potential of {NFV} in enhancing 5G radio access networks' functional, architectural, and commercial viability, including increased automation, operational agility, and reduced capital expenditure. The {ETSI} {NFV} Industry Specification Group has recently published drafts focused on standardization and implementation of {NFV}. Harnessing the potential of 5G and network functions virtualization, we discuss how {NFV} can address critical 5G design challenges through service abstraction and virtualized computing, storage, and network resources. We describe {NFV} implementation with network overlay and {SDN} technologies. In our discussion, we cover the first steps in understanding the role of {NFV} in implementing {CoMP}, D2D communication, and ultra densified networks.},

	abstract = {Network function virtualization ({NFV}) has drawn significant attention from both industry and academia as an important shift in telecommunication service provisioning. By decoupling network functions ({NFs}) from the physical devices on which they run, {NFV} has the potential to lead to significant reductions in operating expenses ({OPEX}) and capital expenses ({CAPEX}) and facilitate the deployment of new services with increased agility and faster time-to-value. The {NFV} paradigm is still in its infancy and there is a large spectrum of opportunities for the research community to develop new architectures, systems and applications, and to evaluate alternatives and trade-offs in developing technologies for its successful deployment. In this paper, after discussing {NFV} and its relationship with complementary fields of software defined networking ({SDN}) and cloud computing, we survey the state-of-the-art in {NFV}, and identify promising research directions in this area. We also overview key {NFV} projects, standardization efforts, early implementations, use cases, and commercial products.},

Using {NFV} with {SDN}, network owners can provision new functions rapidly on demand, improve scalability, and leverage microservices. Benefits like these will make {NFV} indispensable for service providers, mobile operators, telcos, and enterprises alike.Network Functions Virtualization ({NFV}) with a Touch of {SDN} is the first practical introduction to {NFV}’s fundamental concepts, techniques, and use cases. Written for wide audiences of network engineers, architects, planners, and operators, it assumes no previous knowledge of {NFV} architecture, deployment, or management.The authors first explain how virtualization, {VMs}, containers, and related technologies establish the foundation for the {NFV} transformation. Next, they show how these concepts and technologies can be applied to virtualize network functions in the cloud, data centers, routing, security, and the mobile packet core.You’ll discover new tools and techniques for managing and orchestrating virtualized network devices, and gain new clarity on how {SDN} and {NFV} interact and interrelate. By the time you’re done, you’ll be ready to assess vendor claims, evaluate architectures, and plan {NFV}’s role in your own networks.
