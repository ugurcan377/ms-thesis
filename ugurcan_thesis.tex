\section{Introduction}
National Institute of Standards and Technology defines cloud computing as a model for enabling
easy access to a pool of computing resources that requires minimal intervention from the service
provider. With cloud services, any person or organization can buy computing resources from providers
without the need of investing in computing infrastructure themselves. 

One of the essential technologies for implementing cloud services is virtualization. In modern cloud
environments the usually preferred method for virtualization is called hypervisor based virtualization.
Xen and KVM can be called the two most common free and open source hypervisors. While Xen is used in
biggest public cloud platform Amazon Web Services, KVM is used in Google Cloud Platform and Openstack.

The main goal for the hypervisors is to isolate virtual machines in physical host to a degree that they
are no different than separate computers in a network. Virtual machines run a seperate operating system
called guest operating system and hypervisor mediates the system calls to the host operating system.
This technique is very efficient at isolating virtual machines but it also introduces an overhead
since there is an extra layer of abstraction. Previous studies show that while CPU and memory overhead
is minimal, biggest overheads occur in I/O operations. There is also some operational overheads that
comes from running an separate full-fledged guest OS. It also needs to be maintained and updated.

Recently there is another method of virtualization gaining traction in both research and the industry.
It's called operating system level virtualization or more commonly container virtualization.With
container virtualization virtual machines or containers have their own process and resource space but
they use host machines kernel and resources directly. Without the need of complete isolation and an
unaware guest OS container virtualization can achieve faster start up times, less resource consumption
and smaller images. But since all containers use the same kernel isolation between different containers
is weaker.

The earliest attempt for operating system level virtualization can be traced to the UNIX chmod command.
It is introduced in UNIX version 7 at year of 1979. By that time it could only provide file system
isolation. But FreeBSD jails is the first mechanism that can truly be called a container in a modern
sense. It was developed by Poul-Henning Kamp at 1998 and introduced in FreeBSD version 4 at 2000.
Jailed processed can't see other processes, can access only a specific part of their file systems and
have their own IP addresses. At Linux side, OpenVZ project developed a specialized kernel for running
containers at 2006. Contrary to jails, OpenVZ is more akin to a virtual machines. OpenVZ containers
have their own user structure, subject to configurable resource limits and can be migrated to separate
physical machines without the need of shutting down.

Despite both the concept and the technologies that make it possible were around for some time.
Containers are only recently started to see wide spread adoption. This can be explain with a couple
reasons. While Linux became one of the major platforms in the server domain there wasn't any container
technology available that can be run on an unmodified Linux kernel. Furthermore Linux kernel lacked
some of the essential capabilities to implement a container system such as resource management for
processes. Before cgroups was introduced in 2008 Linux kernel didn't have the capacity for controlling
and limiting the resources of a process or group of processes. Using cgroups and earlier introduced
kernel namespaces in the same year first native Linux
container project LXC was announced. While it didn't see much adopted by itself. It formed the basis
for the most of the modern container technologies.
\section{Docker}
Docker is a container virtualization technology that is developed in 2013 by a software company called
dotCloud. Among the modern container technologies Docker is the most widely used one and it would also
be fair to say Docker project's success is partially responsible for the recent adoption of container
virtualization technology. This might be attributed to Docker's different approach on how to prepare 
and use containers.

Virtual machines are used to be considered as virtual equivalents of physical dedicated servers and for
some time containers are also thought as faster and more lightweight virtual machines. But the main
contribution of Docker is focusing into an application instead of a server. Docker provides tools for
packaging an application and all of it’s dependencies together to run the application inside of a
container. Furthermore Docker proposes that each component of an application should be run in a 
different container thus encouraging developers to use a loosely coupled software architecture that is 
also called micro service architecture. According to micro service architectures managing and updating
individual components of applications are easier compared to managing a monolithic application which
all of it’s components runs in same environments and problems in one component can affect the whole
application.
